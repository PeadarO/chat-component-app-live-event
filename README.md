# ReactJS Live Stream Chat Starter Kit


#### Project status
- Development environment can be started with `npm install && npm start`
- Template design Sketch file is symbolized to prepare for one to one maping with React components.
- Login page is "pixel perfect" beside color and luminosity to be fixed.

#### Background
React JS is now the most used framework used by Internet companies to develop the web apps they generate most revenue from.

React offers an easy way to group UI elements into Components so a Chat application can turn from a 100 UI objects, or more, to a 5 UI objects application, and experience less than 250ms delivery time from anywhere to anywhere in the world.

Once a developer uses React Components it becomes a matter of hours before a full fledged mission critical chat solution is offered to anyone in the world who wants to connect.

By leveraging open source tools and components it is possible to create a world class, mission critical, and maintainable chat service, surfacing over the web and mobile devices, while relying on an infrastructure provider to deliver messages anywhere on the Internet.

A reliable Chat back-end provider offers message deliverability, presence indicators and other related data in a predictable fashion so the React based front end can not only be suited to users taste and current habits but, no puns intended, also react to network messages without which there is no UI that would serve any user.

## What to do with this repository?

This is an example of how to integrate open source components, including React chat components, with one notable message and presence service provider: PubNub. PubNub is offering a solid Java Script SDK to drive the React components along with the business specific logic.

This repository is based, not only on a reliable chat backend provider, already processing billions of messages, but also it is based only on open source tools with significant following on github so there is a better chance to see them maintained in the future.

You should only have to bring the design if you want to change it and the repository does provide some starter ones.

The repository includes the javascript libraries that allow for easier access to the chat service provider without the need to use a lower level interface such as REST.

It also includes standard React components that can be dressed up through standard css files that can be generated by any designer tool suite, including Sketch and Adobe XD. If also using some intelligent tools available to designers, such as Sketch2React, it is also possible to generate the React Chat App, almost entirely, through the designers pushing to a github repository automatically their designs and updates.

## What does this repository contain?

* A sample Sketch design file that maps to the css delivered in the source code so your Chat app can look designer generated.

* React files, and React js libraries, in typescript, allowing to run a web application for a Chat app.

* A list of third party libraries used in the app is available in the package.json file. The command « yarn install » ran from the terminal will update your code with fresh cloned files for the versions of these libraries indicated right after their names under the header: dependencies in the package.json file located at the top of the project directory.

* A Chat component library to display the chat UI and content.

* PubNub React library to connect people together through the Chat app this project generates.
